    ORDER MATTERS AND WAS WRONG UNTIL T018. The previous implementation stripped
    tags first and unescaped entities second, so a page that delivers policy
    prose as escaped markup inside a JSON payload leaked a literal tag into the
    text the retrieval model reads: `(&lt;abbr&gt;NCD&lt;/abbr&gt;)` came back
    as `(<abbr>NCD</abbr>)`. Entities are now unescaped BEFORE tags are removed,
    and the pair is repeated until the text stops changing so doubly escaped
    markup also resolves. The pass count is capped so a pathological input
    cannot spin.

    THE TAG PATTERN MUST BE TAG SHAPED, T020. The removal pattern used to be
    `<[^>]+>`, which matches any run from a bare `<` to the next `>` no matter
    what lies between. The Carelon Joint Surgery guideline is a PDF whose
    extracted text carries ten `<` and eight `>` characters in its imaging
    tables, for example `Alpha angle < 55° Normal` and `< 32° Insignificant 39°
    - 42° Borderline >`. The old pattern therefore deleted 167,471 of the
    241,279 extracted characters, including the region at offset 154,826 that
    holds CPT 27447 and its total knee arthroplasty descriptor. Every match run
    through normalize_for_match then reported that document as NOT containing
    27447 while it plainly does, with no error anywhere. That is the fifth false
    absence on this board and, like the other four, it points the flattering
    way: a row whose attestation cannot be confirmed leaves the scored set and
    enlarges the abstention pool that the headline metric rewards. The pattern
    now requires a real tag opening and forbids a further `<` inside the tag,
    so a stray angle bracket in prose can only ever consume prose up to the next
    angle bracket, never across one.

    THIS IS NOT A LOGIN WALL AND MUST NEVER BE MERGED WITH ONE. A login wall is

    simply were not allowed to read it. A bot block must therefore NEVER produce
    a row class, and a blocked fetch must never be scored as model behaviour.

    Why this exists. One recorded payer host, www.horizonblue.com, answers a
    non-browser request with HTTP 200 and a stub of about 930 bytes whose whole
    visible text is `Request unsuccessful. Incapsula incident ID: ...`. Run
    against that stub, detect_login_wall returns (False, None), so before this
    function the harness could not tell a blocked fetch from a successful one.
    The direction of that blindness is not neutral: a blocked fetch makes the
    retrieval model abstain, and abstention is what the headline metric rewards,
    so we would have scored our own network conditions as model caution.

  // CONSERVATIVE-CARE questions — the four things a patient may have tried
  // before surgery. Per the surgeon's clinical model, patients typically must
  // have tried at least 2 OF THESE 4: (1) activity modification, (2) anti-
  // inflammatories, (3) injections, (4) formal physical therapy.
  //
  // We ask by RECENCY ("in the last 6 months"), NOT by dates, session counts,
  // or months of therapy — those are backend/insurer-threshold logic for later,
  // never asked here. No doctor or pharmacy record is required to say yes (an
  // over-the-counter Advil counts). Every answer is PREPOPULATED "yes"
  // (`default: "yes"`) because most patients have tried these, but the patient
  // can change any answer — nothing is locked. A "yes" means it goes into the
  // appeal as "tried it, and it didn't give lasting relief."
  //
  // `followup` (when present) is the light lasting-vs-not nuance captured only
  // when the answer is yes. `reassure` drives the gentle 2-of-4 guidance —
  // this is reassurance, NOT a hard gate; progress is never blocked on it.
  //
  // Copy is body-part-generic ("your joint" / "your pain"), so it reads
  // correctly for a knee, shoulder, or spine patient. NOTE: imaging (X-ray /
  // MRI) is NOT in this list — it is derived from bodyPart via `imaging` /
  // `imagingByBodyPart` above.

"""Autonomous execution of a prepared arm work order using the Claude CLI.

The original harness spawned `codex exec` wrapped in macOS `sandbox-exec`.
Neither binary exists on Linux, so no arm could ever run here. This module is
the Linux execution engine. It reuses the isolation pattern already proven by
scripts/policy_eval/retrieve.py:

  claude -p <prompt>
      --tools ""                 removes every built-in tool (no Read, no Bash)
      --mcp-config <file>        supplies exactly two tools: web_search, http_fetch
      --strict-mcp-config        ignores every other MCP server on this host
      --allowedTools / --disallowedTools   belt and braces on top of --tools ""
      cwd = a temp directory outside this repository

Because the agent has no file tools, it cannot write result.json itself. It
returns one JSON object on stdout and this module writes the arm artifacts.

PATIENT-VISIBLE SUBMISSION
{_transcript_text(work_order)}
{revision}
OPERATING RULES
1. Treat the submission as real. Do not assume facts that were not supplied.
2. First normalize payer, product clues, state, procedure, CPT if present, dates,
   and the stated denial language.
3. Perform a genuine retrieval attempt with web_search and http_fetch.
4. Prefer the exact current official payer policy. Verify payer entity, product,
   state, procedure, effective date, and delegated vendor applicability.
5. Label every candidate with evidence_role. A form, code list, policy index, or
   routing guide is supporting_document, never governing_policy.
6. Record every serious candidate and a concise observable reason for selecting
   or rejecting it. Never include private chain-of-thought.
7. Read the selected document itself. Do not rely on uncited summaries.
8. Distinguish missing documentation, genuinely unmet criteria, administrative
   denial, benefit exclusion, investigational denial, site-of-service issue, and
   unresolved uncertainty.
9. Ask only questions a patient can reasonably answer. Route chart-dependent
   facts to the provider.
10. Recommend the most immediately actionable evidence-supported next step that
    favors the patient. Do not promise coverage and do not invent a deadline.
11. Use status "blocked" only after recording attempted candidates and a concrete
    external blocker. It must never mean that work was not attempted.

OUTPUT
Your final response must be exactly one JSON object conforming to this schema.
Do not wrap it in Markdown fences and do not add commentary before or after it.
